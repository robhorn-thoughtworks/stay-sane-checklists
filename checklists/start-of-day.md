Stuff changes all of the time, it's one of the few constants in life.  Much of my time is spent reacting to things, whilst also trying to juggle the commitments I have made to others.  To help me deal with this I combine a couple of techniques:  
- I use bits from Getting Stuff Done - like having trusted list in [Remember the milk (RTM)](https://www.rememberthemilk.com)
- I try to get things out of my head, so write stuff down in my notebook
- I also take inspiration from the [Emergent Task Planner](https://davidseah.com/node/the-emergent-task-planner/) from [David Seah](https://www.davidseah.com)

So at the start of the every day, typically whilst commuting, I:
__Capture schedule for the day__  
_I fire up my calendar and capture it in my notebook._

__Understand ToDo List items due today__  
_I take a look at RTM and capture the things that I must do today.  They are things I have committed to deliver for others, or promises made to myself._

__Realistically consider available time__  
_I then take a look at my schedule, and the committed ToDo list items and ask myself how much time am I going to get to give attention to other things on the ToDo list_

__Capture today's ToDo List__  
_If appropriate I will add to the ToDo list for today, if not I won't._

__Set a mission for the day__  
_It is also quite uplifting and rewarding to set yourself a mission for the day.  Specify these in terms of something that you have achieved - it will become self fulfilling.  E.g. "Today I have practiced active listening techniques."_

So that is it - 10 mins and I have a game plan for the day.  I know and am comfortable that some, or a good part of it will change, and that's OK.  I will do what I can to deliver on the commitments I have made, but won't beat myself up if I fail to complete other items on the ToDo list for the day.
